# Projects Page Styling Update

## Backup Created

The original projects page has been backed up to:
`src/app/projects/page.jsx.backup`

## To Revert to Original

If you don't like the new styling, simply run:

```bash
cd /home/plasma/Charan/Portfolio/V2/portfolio/test/test1/portfolio
cp src/app/projects/page.jsx.backup src/app/projects/page.jsx
```

Or I can do it for you - just let me know!
